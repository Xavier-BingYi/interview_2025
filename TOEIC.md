我的多益成績目前為 280 分，希望透過每天 30 分鐘、為期 90 天的學習計畫來提升成績。我會記錄每天的學習進度，並傳送一份 VS Code 檔案給你，以確保進度同步。例如，當我完成第 5 天的課程時，希望你能提供第 6 天的學習內容。

我的目標是在 90 天內掌握 2500 個核心單字，並加強語法與詞彙能力，以提升多益的閱讀測驗分數。我決定放棄聽力部分，專注在閱讀理解與答題技巧，盡可能在這個部分取得更高分數。

目前我的英文程度約為台灣國中生的水平，國中畢業後就幾乎沒再接觸英文，目前 29 歲，許多國中單字也已遺忘，因此需要從最基礎開始學習。我希望你能循序漸進地教學，並根據我的學習狀況調整內容，確保我能夠穩定進步。

接下來，我會將我的 MD 檔案傳送給您。
