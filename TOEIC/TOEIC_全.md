Each department must assign one person to handle supply requests and submit a consolidated order at the end of each month.

If you have any questions, please contact Ms. Lydia Wu in the purchasing department.

Subject: Infrastructure Overhaul – Project Launch Phase

Dear All,

We are excited to announce the launch of Phase 1 of our Infrastructure Overhaul Initiative, a project that will modernize our logistics network and integrate cloud-based tracking systems. This initiative, which has been in planning since Q3 of last year, will streamline operations and facilitate real-time data analysis across all warehouses.

The rollout begins next Monday, starting with the northern region. Staff training and onboarding have already commenced, and a liaison from the IT team will be assigned to each branch. Please note that temporary delays in shipment tracking may occur during system migration. Your cooperation and patience are highly appreciated.

We believe this transition, though complex, will yield long-term benefits and greatly improve our service responsiveness.

This change is part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at reducing operational costs and preventing redundant spending.

Additionally, a centralized procurement portal will be launched to track orders, manage inventory turnover, and maintain transparency. Training on how to use the new system will be conducted next week by a designated liaison from the IT team.

Please be advised that orders placed outside the portal will not be processed. Your cooperation is critical to the success of this transition.

## 📖 文法學習：強調副詞開頭句型（Emphatic Adverbs at Sentence Start）

### 🔹 說明

某些副詞（如：Only then, Never, Rarely, Not until, Hardly...when）若放在句首以表強調，會觸發**句子倒裝**（助動詞提前）：

- **Only then** did he understand the message.
- **Never** have we seen such results.
- **Hardly** had I arrived **when** the meeting began.

這與一般倒裝句不同，特別出現在具有**否定、副詞片語或頻率副詞**開頭時。

### 🔹 常見句首強調副詞

| 副詞片語       | 中文意思         |
|----------------|------------------|
