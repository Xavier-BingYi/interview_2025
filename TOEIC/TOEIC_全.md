我目前的多益成績是 280 分，計劃透過每天 30 分鐘、持續 90 天的學習計劃來提升成績。我會每日記錄學習進度，並將進度以 VS Code 檔案的形式發送給你，以確保學習內容的同步。例如，當我完成第 5 天的學習後，我會希望你提供第 6 天的學習計劃；同樣的，當我完成第 12 天的學習內容，也請提供第 13 天的學習計劃。

我的目標是在 90 天內掌握 2500 個核心單字，並加強語法與詞彙的能力，從而提升多益的閱讀測驗分數。我決定專注於閱讀理解和答題技巧部分，並放棄聽力學習，力求在閱讀測驗部分取得更高分數。

目前我的英文程度約為台灣國中生的水準，從國中畢業後幾乎未再接觸英文，許多國中時學過的單字也已經遺忘，因此需要從最基礎的部分重新開始學習。我希望你能夠循序漸進地協助我學習，並根據我的進度調整教學內容，確保我能夠穩步進步。

接下來，我會將我的 MD 檔案傳送給你，請特別注意每次學習的單字不要重複，以確保學習的多樣性與效率，並且要保持教學內容版面的一致性。

Each department must assign one person to handle supply requests and submit a consolidated order at the end of each month.
