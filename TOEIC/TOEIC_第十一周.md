## 📖 文法學習：倒裝句型（Inversion Structures）

### 🔹 說明

倒裝句將副詞或介系詞片語放在句首，導致主詞與動詞語序顛倒。常用於強調、條件、省略 if 的假設語氣等語境中。

### 🔹 常見句型

- **Rarely / Never / Seldom / Hardly / Little / Not only + 助動詞 + 主詞 + 原形動詞**
  - e.g., **Rarely have we seen** such dedication.
- **Only if / Only after / Only when / Not until + 助動詞倒裝**
  - e.g., **Only after the meeting was over did he speak.**
- **Had + 主詞 + p.p., 主詞 + would/could/might have + p.p.**
  - e.g., **Had I known**, I would have acted sooner.
