Dear All,

We are excited to announce the launch of Phase 1 of our Infrastructure Overhaul Initiative, a project that will modernize our logistics network and integrate cloud-based tracking systems.

Subject: Important Notice – Policy Changes to Procurement Process

Dear Colleagues,

Starting next month, the procurement policy will be revised to increase efficiency and accountability. All department purchases above $3,000 must now be pre-approved by the Finance Division. This change is part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at reducing operational costs and preventing redundant spending.

Additionally, a centralized procurement portal will be launched to track orders, manage inventory turnover, and maintain transparency. Training on how to use the new system will be conducted next week by a designated liaison from the IT team.

Please be advised that orders placed outside the portal will not be processed. Your cooperation is critical to the success of this transition.

To: All Department Heads  
From: CFO Office  
Subject: Preliminary Budget Review for Q3

Dear Managers,

As part of our fiscal planning for the upcoming quarter, all departments are required to submit their preliminary budget reports by June 5th. This initial review will help identify discrepancies, evaluate capital expenditure plans, and anticipate cash flow requirements. Please note that any proposed discretionary spending above $10,000 must be justified in a separate document.

Additionally, all expenses projected as contingent or deferred must be labeled accordingly. Overhead cost estimates should be itemized, and any anticipated liabilities or severance obligations must be flagged for review. 

Your timely cooperation is essential to ensure we maintain solvency and align our expenditures with corporate goals.

Thank you,  
Finance Division
