## 📖 文法學習：強調副詞開頭句型（Emphatic Adverbs at Sentence Start）

### 🔹 說明

某些副詞（如：Only then, Never, Rarely, Not until, Hardly...when）若放在句首以表強調，會觸發**句子倒裝**（助動詞提前）：

- **Only then** did he understand the message.
- **Never** have we seen such results.
- **Hardly** had I arrived **when** the meeting began.

這與一般倒裝句不同，特別出現在具有**否定、副詞片語或頻率副詞**開頭時。

### 🔹 常見句首強調副詞

| 副詞片語       | 中文意思         |
|----------------|------------------|
| Only then      | 直到那時         |
| Never          | 從未             |

Beginning next quarter, the Sales Department will implement a revised quota allocation model.

This change is designed to create a more equitable and data-driven framework for performance assessment.

Failure to meet the revised targets for two consecutive quarters may result in performance reviews or territory reassignment.

To: All Treasury Department Staff  
From: Chief Risk Officer  
Subject: Policy Update on Liquidity and Leverage Controls

In response to increased market volatility, we are updating our internal policies regarding liquidity thresholds and leverage limits. Effective immediately, all departments must conduct weekly solvency ratio reviews and report any anomalies by Friday noon.

In addition, all new outlays above $100,000 must be pre-approved by the Executive Finance Committee. Failing to comply with this policy will result in a freeze on discretionary budgets for the following quarter.

A training session on updated ledgering protocols and provisioning standards will be held on Thursday. Attendance is mandatory for all financial officers and analysts.
