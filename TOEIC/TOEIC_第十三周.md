To: All Logistics Personnel  
From: Operations Director  
Subject: New Outsourcing Initiative

Beginning next month, several non-core logistics tasks will be outsourced to a third-party subcontractor specializing in distribution. This change aims to enhance delivery speed and allow in-house teams to focus on strategic planning. Affected employees will be reassigned to other roles, and no layoffs are expected.

All current contracts and supply chain schedules will remain unchanged during the transition. Weekly performance reports will be shared with stakeholders to ensure transparency.

Further details will be provided in Monday’s briefing.
